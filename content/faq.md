#### How can I make a booking?

You can make a booking in a number of ways. The easiest is to go to the [book a lesson](/book) page.

#### What if the time I want for my lesson isn't available?

We will always offer you an alternative time slot, and we have limited availability on Sunday evenings.

As our clients pass their exams, there are always new times for bookings becoming free.  Register your details on our reservation list and you will be contacted as soon as your preferred time is available.

#### I've lived in the UK for ten years.  Why do I need to study to pass my Life in the UK test?

Unfortunately, a lot of the questions on the test are based on the history and geography curriculum in British secondary schools so if you have been educated in a different system this knowledge isn't intuitive.   If you try a practice test and find it challenging, then a short course of tuition sessions would be helpful.

#### My English is perfect.  Why do I have to take a language test?

Unfortunately, unless you are a British Citizen, you will need to take the language test regardless of your current proficiency!  This is common in several countries.  It's also a standard requirement for many British universities.

The passing grade for the Cambridge exam is a B1, which is equivalent to a GCSE grade C (or 5 under the new GCSE criteria).

When you book a tuition session, you can specify in the comments section for the focus to be on the Life in the UK test instead of the language requirement. 

#### How can I make sure that I meet the UK Citizenship requirements?

Check the Home Office website carefully for all current information.

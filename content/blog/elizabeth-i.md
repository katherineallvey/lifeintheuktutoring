When Henry VIII dies, his son,[ EDWARD VI](https://youtu.be/ACQy3x3pJ88), became king.  Edward was only nine when he became king.  He decided that people should be able to pray in English when they went to church.  He wrote [THE BOOK OF COMMON PRAYER](https://youtu.be/yEQWe-2aXVo) and some churches still use this today!  Unfortunately, he was not healthy and died when he was fifteen.   

Edward's sister, [MARY I,](https://youtu.be/1eaMix9x4HE) became the new queen.  She was [KATHERINE OF ARAGON](https://youtu.be/MbTHSc4Mb1I)'s daughter.  She was a Catholic and hated Protestants.  She made the Catholic Church the official church in England and persecuted many protestants.  Her nickname was Bloody Mary.

Mary died without having a child so her sister, [ELIZABETH I,](https://youtu.be/Jmhak-RI67o) became queen.  She was  [ANNE BOLEYN](https://youtu.be/vNP502RPeKk), 's daughter.  She made the Church of England the official church again, but made sure other people could worship in their own ways.  She found a balance between Protestants and Catholics that made her very popular.

In 1588 there was a big threat to England.  The spanish king, Phillip, was so angry that England was Protestant that he sent a huge fleet of ships called an [ARMADA ](https://youtu.be/mGyjxcTII_k)to attack England!  Luckily, bad weather and smart sailing from the English meant that the Armada was defeated.

The scottish queen, [MARY (QUEEN OF SCOTS)](https://youtu.be/_zroAUC3y8Y), was another problem for England.  Mary had grown up in France and was a catholic.  Scotland hated Catholics and were strongly Protestant.  When Mary went back to Scotland she was told she couldn't be queen and her baby son had to be the new king.  Mary was terrified and ran away to England where Elizabeth could help.  Elizabeth was kind to Mary until she found evidence that Mary wanted to take over, so Elizabeth had Mary executed after keeping her prisoner for twenty years.

Elizabeth's reign was a great time for England.  One of her commanders, [SIR FRANCIS DRAKE](https://youtu.be/xgXd06kKFIQ), was the first man to circumnavigate (sail the whole way round) the world.  British people began to move to the new country of Amrica and start towns there.  England became famous for it's poetry and theatre.

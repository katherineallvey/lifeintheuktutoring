 People have been living in the UK since the stone age! Britain used to be connected to the rest of Europe through a land bridge so people and animals like deer and horse can come and go as they liked.  Around 10,000 years ago that bridge disappeared and cut Britain off from the mainland.

 [6000 years ago](https://youtu.be/pWHCyyWCCLc) farmers began to move back to Britain, probably from south east Europe.  We know this because they left us clues like houses, tombs and monuments that archaeologists have found.

 The biggest clue about life in the UK thousands of years ago is  [STONEHENGE](https://youtu.be/_RyqU1r1Fmk), the beautiful monument in Wiltshire.  Experts think this was a special place for ceremonies or seasonal celebrations. In the remote Scottish island of Orkney a full prehistoric village called [SKARA BRAE](https://youtu.be/de4kOrOaNyI) was discovered.  This is the best preserved ancient village in Europe and has help archaeologists come to grips with life in the Stone Age in the UK

 Two thousand years after Stonehenge was built, a fabulous new discovery came to Britain: Metal!  The [BRONZE AGE](https://youtu.be/cH_uowNBJno) enabled people to be more sophisticated and create tools, weapons and art from various metals.  Houses were improved and funerals became more important, with leaders buried in barrows.  As life was getting more recognisable as our own, money started being used.  The first coins found in the UK have been from the Iron Age, and had portraits of kings on one side, just like our pound coins do today.

 The later [IRON AGE](https://youtu.be/j6rCMTOss_k) meant that weapons got tougher, and inhabitants began to form towns. Hill Forts like [MAIDEN CASTLE ](https://youtu.be/kxIbczNR9a8) in Dorset made defence easier.  Most people had jobs as farmers, craftspeople or warriors.   

 The language that people spoke in the Iron Age was [CELTIC](https://youtu.be/Wwwclcz7_q4), which evolved into the  traditional Scottish, Welsh and Irish languages.

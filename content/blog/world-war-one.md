 At the start of the Twntieth century, British people  were feeling optimistic because their lives were getting better.  However, in other parts of Europe, things were not so good.  Lots of countries had agreements together to stop war and make sure no country got too powerful.  

 This British ptimism was stopped when[ ARCHDUKE FRANZ FERDINAND](https://www.biography.com/people/franz-ferdinand-9300680), who was going to be King of Austria one day was killed in 1914.  This made all the agreements between the countries in Europe stop working and led to the start of the[ FIRST WORLD WAR](https://youtu.be/fi1OyVB2laY).  While the First World War took place in Europe, soldiers from all over the world war involved.  Britain was part of what was called the Allied Powers, which included France, Russia, Japan, Belgium, Serbia and, a bit later, Greece, Italy, Romania and the USA.   

 Countries from all over the [BRITISH EMPIRE ](https://youtu.be/TM50B_RtT4U) were involved.  More than a million [INDIAN SOLDIERS](https://youtu.be/naiAc9xorFk) came to Europe to fight and 40% of them were killed. Men from the West Indies, Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Cana fought with the Allied Powers.  More than two million British soldiers died.  The[ BATTLE OF THE SOMME ](https://youtu.be/ietYhbiFeYs) in July 1916, included the single worst day in british military history, as 60,000  British soldiers died on the first day alone.

   
   
  

 The first World War officially ended on the 11th November 1918.  This is called [REMEMBRANCE DAY](https://youtu.be/W5Y9UXZaA4A) or Armistice Day, and this is commemorated with a minutes silence at 11am every year.  Some people choose to wear red poppies as a symbol of respect to the soldiers who died.

[WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE](https://youtu.be/wVF8Q-zZz00) was a famous poet and playwright who wrote and performed in Elizabeth I's reign. He was born in Stratford Upon Avon, near Birmingham.  Some of his most famous plays are [MACBETH](https://youtu.be/qfnUq2_0FOY), [HAMLET](https://youtu.be/OtNMjZoZNbM), [ROMEO AND JULIET ](https://youtu.be/J93bQ-29l8I)and [A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM](https://youtu.be/J93bQ-29l8I).   

Shakespeare was different from other writers as he wrote about ordinary people as well as kings and queens.  He rewrote stories from history and also made up new ones.  He loved making up new words and lots of them we use today.  Have you heard any of these phrases before?

*  	Once more unto the breach (Henry V)
*  	To be or not to be... (Hamlet)
*  	A rose by any other name (Romeo and Juliet)
*  	All the world's a stage (As You Like it)
*  	The darling buds of may (Sonnet 18)

Shakespeare wrote all of these and you will hear people saying them now!

Some people think Shakespeare was the greatest writer of all time.  Children study his plays and poems in school every year.

The Globe Theatre (Next to the Tate Modern on the South Bank in London) is a modern version of Shakespeare's own theatre.  They always perform his plays.  If you want to feel like an elizabethan Londoner, you can pay Â£5 to get a standing ticket and enjoy Shakespeare's plays the same way people did 500 years ago!

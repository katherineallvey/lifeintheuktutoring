title = "Henry VIII"

+++
Henry became King in 1509.  His dad, Henry VII, had left England with a lot of spare money, so Henry made a really good start to his reign.  Henry VII also wanted centralised power, where the whole of England was led by one person and all the decisions were made by the king and his advisors.  Henry thought this was a great idea too and carried on with his policy.

Spain was a very powerful country at this time so Henry married [KATHERINE OF ARAGON](https://youtu.be/MbTHSc4Mb1I), a spanish princess.  She was a Catholic and had a strong faith in God.  Unfortunately, she only had one child, a girl called Mary.

Henry was very angry!  Who would be king after him if he only had a daughter?  He had also got a new girlfriend, [ANNE BOLEYN](https://youtu.be/vNP502RPeKk), and really wanted to marry her instead.

The problem was that at this time you couldn't divorce your partner if you were Catholic.  Henry asked the POPE, Head of the Catholic Church, if he could divorce Katherine, and of course he said no.

Henry decided to make his own church instead.  He called it the Church of England (what we call Anglican or CofE today) and said that in his church divorce was fine.  Katherine of Aragon retired to the countryside and Anne became his new wife.

The [CHURCH OF ENGLAND](https://youtu.be/Zkp7TPZHjyA) is very important to British History.  For the first time, people were allowed to read the bible in their own languages, not just in Latin, which was the ancient language spoken by Romans.  The Church of England could pick it's own Bishops and priests rather than asking the pope what he thought.  People didn't worhip saints or go to shrines any more.  They believed that a person's relationship to God was the most important thing about their faith.

This church was part of a movement called [PROTESTANTISM](https://youtu.be/1o8oIELbNxE), which questioned whether the Pope should be in charge of people's faith.  By the end of the 16th century, England, Wales and parts of Ireland were all Protestant.

Many people in Ireland, which was part of Britain at this time were angry when Henry told them to be Protestand as well.  They didn't like his laws and rebelled.  Henry sent soldiers to stop the rebellion and many people died.

This was also the time when Wales formally became part of Britain instead of it's own seperate country.

Anne Boleyn had one daughter, Elizabeth.  Henry was even angrier this time.  He made up evidence that Anne had committed crimes and had her executed (killed).  One of his advisors suggested he marry a nice, quiet girl called [JANE SEYMOUR.](https://youtu.be/0GeY4uErgIk)  Shortly after they got married, she died while giving birth to a son, Edward.

Henry's problems didn't end there.  He had the son that he wanted but no other countries liked him because he had a different church and hadn't married their princesses.  He asked an artist to travel around europe and paint pictures of the different princesses and then he could pick the one he liked best.  He chose [ANNE OF CLEVES](https://youtu.be/yVLGsbIaLEo) from Germany.  When she arrived in the UK he thought she was really ugly, so after they got married he divorced her straight away.  Henry gave her a beautiful house and some money to say sorry for wasting her time.

Henry then noticed a beautiful girl at his court.  Her name was [CATHERINE HOWARD](https://youtu.be/mM0EbVVzals) and she loved flirting with boys.  She married Henry, but he got sick of her looking at other boys, made up some evidence and had her executed too.

By now, Henry was an old man.  He needed a wife who would look after him when he was sick, and was a calm and caring person.  He married an older lady called [CATHERINE PARR](https://youtu.be/0h6DasXvTq4), who looked after him when he stopped being healthy.  Henry died in 1547, and his son Edward became the new king.  Catherine Parr found a new husband and lived happily until her old age.

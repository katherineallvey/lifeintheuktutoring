 By the year 1066, there was a huge issue in England.  The king, Edward the Confessor, had died without a son.  The next ruler looked to be a leader from southern England called Harold.  The ruler of Normandy in France, William, wanted England for himself  He sailed to England and met Haroldâ€™s army at what is now called the [BATTLE OF HASTINGS](https://youtu.be/oLy1LskT6Y8).  William won and became William I off England, of [WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR](https://youtu.be/_rrvrvPjN-0).

 William wanted to record his great victory so he commissioned the [BAYEUX TAPESTRY](https://youtu.be/LtGoBZ4D4_E) which shows his entire campaign.  This was the last successful invasion of Britain and it took place almost a thousand years ago!.  William wanted to conquer Wales too, but the Welsh people fought back and kept their independence.  Scotland proved just as tough to conquer, but the Normans managed to get some land in Scotland despite many battles.  

 As the Normans spoke French, this language became used by the upper classes.  Society also began following the French way of life rather than the ancient English ways,

 William wanted to  get a record of all the people and objects in his new kingdom, so he sent his officials out to keep a list of everything they could find.  This became known as the [DOMESDAY BOOK ](https://youtu.be/om_BIzXaVwU)and some towns and areas in the UK which are listen we can still see today!

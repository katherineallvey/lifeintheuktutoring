One of the first British composers to make their mark was [HENRY PURCELL](https://youtu.be/VVivtti-n-w), who lived between 1659 and 1695.  His first job was as the organ player at Westminster Abbey, but then he started to write music for choirs and churches and created a style that was unique to Britain.  His work still influences religious music today.

 Visiting composers to Britain left their mark too.  The German-born composer George Frederick Handel lived in Britain for many years and eventually became a British citizen in 1727.  He wrote [WATER MUSIC](https://youtu.be/cnn3TVBDtcA) for King George I and [MUSIC FOR THE ROYAL FIREWORKS](https://youtu.be/i7vJ2UFbeXA) for his son, George II.  Handel also wrote music for choirs to perform: the most famous example of his religious music is the [HALLELUJAH CHORUS.](https://youtu.be/IUZEtVbJT5c)

 Gustav Holst, a British born composer who lived for 1874-1934 was inspired to write a set of musical pieces based on the solar system, which he named [THE PLANETS](https://youtu.be/Isic2Z2e2xs).  One of the nine pieces, called [JUPITER](https://youtu.be/Gu77Vtja30c), was written to the same  tune as a popular hymn.

 At the same time Holst was writing, Edward Elgar (1857-1934) was writing famous pieces such as [POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE](https://youtu.be/R2-43p3GVTQ) and the patriotic song [LAND OF HOPE AND GLORY](https://youtu.be/i_ROlkMOL9s).  Every year [THE PROMS ](https://youtu.be/XmPG-qx-yRw)are held to celebrate classical music, and ‘Land of Hope and Glory’ is the song that's played at the end!  While Elgar was writing these tunes, other composers like [RALPH VAUGHN WILLIAMS](https://youtu.be/God7bXyKkdA) became interested in traditional English folk music and trying to show how beautiful it can be.

 Benjamin Britten is another famous British composer who wrote pieces for orchestras.  He wanted children to love classical music so he wrote [THE YOUNG PERSON'S GUIDE TO THE ORCHESTRA](https://youtu.be/KhOEIwNM3e0), in which all the different instruments play in turn.  He loved operas and wrote two called [BILLY BUDD](https://youtu.be/A1lVBfqQyjs) and [PETER GRIMES](https://youtu.be/3MyBUetbE38).  He started a classical music festival in Aldeburgh in Suffolk that is still running today.

 All of these composers wrote a long time ago, but British music wasn't just important in the nineteenth century!  In the 1960s [THE BEATLES](https://youtu.be/1NnCLGKDE14)  began recording in Liverpool and started a world wide phenomenon. Meanwhile, in London, [THE ROLLING STONES](https://youtu.be/V9NaxP7VCCc) used blues music to create their own original sound.  

 In the 1970s music became much more serious.  The Punk movement, with bands like [THE SEX PISTOLS](https://youtu.be/QBVDSz5Qd6g) and[ THE CLASH ](https://youtu.be/80thl-j8jvw)creating a harsher sound and angrier lyrics.  By the nineties, music had become much sweeter with boybands and girlbands ruling the charts. [THE SPICE GIRLS ](https://youtu.be/bj1RSsbg3No)and [TAKE THAT ](https://youtu.be/CIGXG-Ra3Oo)were the most successful groups in the world, despite not playing any instruments!

 Take That, the Rolling Stones and (in the near future) the Spice girls will perform at the UK's biggest and best venues such as Wembley Stadium and The O2 in London, SECC in Glasgow, MEN Arena in Manchester or the Birmingham NEC.

 The UK is also home to a fantastic set of music festivals taking place every summer.  [GLASTONBURY,](https://youtu.be/3kG0wqiJlXo) the Isle of Wight Festival and All Points Eastare the best places to see new and famous bands.  The best are nominated for the Mercury Music Prize, which has a special award for the best band and album from the UK.

 Of course, it's not just England which has amazing festivals.  The National Eisteddfod of Wales has competitions for poetry, dance, music, theatre and art...which must all be performed in Welsh!
